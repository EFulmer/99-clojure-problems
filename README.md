C-99: 99 Clojure Problems
=========================

My own solutions to the 99 Lisp Problems, done in Clojure. You can find the original problems at (http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2006s2/funcional/L-99_Ninety-Nine_Lisp_Problems.html), and a whole bunch of other places online.

I claim absolutely no ownership over anything here. Use them for ideas for your own solutions, claim them as your own, do whatever you like with this code - I'm perfectly fine with it.
